# LoopBack Clients

A collection of client SDK implementations for the
[LoopBack](#http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback) framework. For more
information:

 * [Quick Start](#http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback#quick-start) - The Quick
    Start guide is the best place for a fresh start. Get your mobile-ready
    backend up and running _fast_, then come back here to drop in one of our
    client SDKs.
 * [LoopBack API
    Documentation](#http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback#nodejs-api) - Want
    server-side data validation or custom behaviour? This is the place to look.
    Make your LoopBack project do all the work for you on the server and keep
    your client app lean and mean.
